# Life Expectancy Prediction Project

## Project Overview

This projects involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis and the development a linear regression model. The primary goal is to predict the life expectancy of Middle Layer Super Output Areas (MSOAs) using various socioeconomic factors.

## Aims

- **Build a Linear Regression Model**: The model will predict life expectancy based on the following predictor variables:
  - **Net annual income before household costs**
  - **Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) scores**
  - **Economic inactivity due to long-term sickness or disability (sourced from NOMIS)**

- **Prediction Scenario**: 
  - Predict how life expectancy in Dudley will change following a 10% increase in net annual income before household costs.

## Project Structure

The project will be divided into the following key stages:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Ensuring the dataset is free from errors, missing values, and inconsistencies.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the relationships between the variables and identifying patterns in the data.
3. **Model Building**: Developing a linear regression model to predict life expectancy.
4. **Scenario Analysis**: Applying the model to estimate the impact of a 10% increase in net annual income on life expectancy in Dudley.
