# Excel Data Analysis Project: Coffee Bean Sales

## Project Overview

This Excel project involves the analysis of a dataset comprising 2,000 coffee bean sales records across various US cities. The project encompasses dataset management, data exploration and dashboard development to derive actionable insights from the data.

## Project Highlights

- **Dataset Management**: Sourced and cleaned the dataset to ensure data integrity and accuracy. Utilised advanced Excel functions such as XLOOKUP and INDEX-MATCH for efficient data gathering and manipulation.

- **Data Exploration**: Leveraged pivot tables to summarise and explore the dataset efficiently. Extracted key metrics and visualised trends to identify patterns and insights within the data.

- **Dashboard Development**: Designed an interactive and visually appealing dashboard to present the analysis findings. The dashboard features charts, slicers and a timeline to enable dynamic data segmentation and enhance interactivity for stakeholders.

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Ensured data quality by removing duplicates, handling missing values and standardising data formats.
  
- **Pivot Tables**: Utilised pivot tables to summarise and analyse sales data by various dimensions such as country, date and product type.
  
- **Dashboard Visualisation**: Created dynamic charts (e.g., bar charts) and slicers to provide stakeholders with an intuitive and interactive view of the sales performance.

## How to Use

1. **Download the Excel Workbook**: Clone or download the Excel workbook containing the dataset and analysis.
   
2. **Explore the Data**: Navigate through the different sheets to view the raw data, pivot tables, and dashboard.
