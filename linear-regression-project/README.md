# Life Expectancy Prediction Project

## Project Overview

This projects involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis and the development a linear regression model. The primary goal is to predict the life expectancy of Middle Layer Super Output Areas (MSOAs) using various socioeconomic factors.

## Aims

- **Build a Linear Regression Model**: The model will predict life expectancy based on the following predictor variables:
  - **Net annual income before household costs** 
  - **Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) scores** 
  - **Economic inactivity due to long-term sickness or disability**

- **Prediction Scenario**: 
  - Predict how life expectancy in Birmingham will change following a 15% increase in net annual income before household costs.

## Data Sources
- Life Expectancy data - sourced from the Office of National Statistics.
- Net annual income before household cost - sourced from the Office of National Statistics.
- Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) scores - sourced from mySociety, a non-for-profit social enterprise.
- Economic inactivity due to long-term sickness or disability - sourced from NOMIS.

## Project Structure

The project will be divided into the following key stages:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Ensuring the dataset is free from errors, missing values, and inconsistencies.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the relationships between the variables and identifying patterns in the data.
3. **Model Building**: Developing a linear regression model to predict life expectancy.
4. **Scenario Analysis**: Applying the model to estimate the impact of a 15% increase in net annual income on life expectancy in Birmingham.

## Analysis
A comprehensive evaluation of the model, detailing the rationale behind the model selection, the choice of predictor variables, the impact of these variables on life expectancy, and the reliability of the findings.
