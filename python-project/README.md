## Project Highlights

- **Data Wrangling**: Employed advanced data wrangling techniques, including error handling with try-except blocks, lambda expressions, and custom functions, to ensure the integrity and quality of the dataset.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted thorough EDA to uncover patterns and trends within the dataset. Formulated hypotheses and utilized summary statistics and visualizations to gain insights into the data.

- **Hypothesis Testing**: Formulated and tested hypotheses using various visualization techniques, a including dual-axis chart, scatter plots, and subplots. Communicated findings effectively through visual representations.

## Key Libraries

- **NumPy**: Used for numerical computing and array manipulation.
- **Pandas**: Utilized for data manipulation and analysis, including cleaning, transformation, and aggregation of data.
- **Matplotlib**: Employed for creating static and animated visualizations in Python.
- **Seaborn**: Utilized for statistical data visualization, providing a high-level interface for drawing informative and visually appealing plots..
