## Project Aims
1. Ensure the dataset is accurate, complete and ready for analysis.
2. Gain insights into the characteristics and trends of ultramarathon races.
3. Formulate hypotheses concerning ultramarathon races.
4. Extract valuable insights based on the findings from data cleaning, exploratory data analysis and hypothesis testing.

## Project Highlights

- **Data Wrangling**: Employed advanced data wrangling techniques, including error handling with try-except blocks, applied lambda expressions and custom functions to ensure the integrity and quality of the dataset.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted thorough EDA to uncover patterns and trends within the dataset. Formulated hypotheses and utilised summary statistics and visualisations to gain insights into the data.

- **Hypothesis Testing**: Formulated and tested hypotheses using various visualisation techniques, including a dual-axis chart, scatter plots and subplots. Communicated findings effectively through visual representations.

## Key Libraries

- **NumPy**: Used for numerical computing and array manipulation.
- **Pandas**: Utilised for data manipulation and analysis, including cleaning, transformation and aggregation of data.
- **Matplotlib**: Employed for creating static and animated visualisations in Python.
- **Seaborn**: Utilised for statistical data visualisation, providing a high-level interface for drawing informative and visually appealing plots.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) using the following command: pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the Python scripts to execute data analysis and visualisation tasks.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates proficiency in Python programming and data analysis techniques, showcasing the ability to clean and analyse large datasets, derive meaningful insights and communicate findings effectively through visualisation.
